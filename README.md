# Rockay City Subway (un)official website

In Crime Boss: Rockay City there's a banner that shows map of Rockay City Subway and a domain railwayrockaycity.com

It wasn't taken, I bought it, and made a website that resembles [official MTA website from 2001](https://web.archive.org/web/20011026041713/https://www.mta.info/)

It's intentionally written in very outdated ways. That's part of the joke.
